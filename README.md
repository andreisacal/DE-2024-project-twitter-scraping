# Week 01 - Data Engineering Project for Scraping Tweets

Welcome to my journey in the world of data engineering! As I embark on this exciting endeavour, I am thrilled to share with you my passion for mastering the skill of transforming raw data into valuable insights. With each passing weekend, I am committed to challenging myself to complete a new data engineering project in order to push the boundaries of my skills and knowledge.

Through this series of projects, I aim to not only deepen my understanding of fundamental data engineering concepts but also to improve my practical abilities in designing robust data pipelines, optimising data workflows and leveraging the power of tools and technologies.
